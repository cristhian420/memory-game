Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famuos writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version.

In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on setting Attributes in JavaScript.

I have kept the styling at a bare miniumum for you to go wild and make it your own. Please tag me as I would LOVE to see your game!!!

## What inbuilt functions are we going to focus on?
- for loops
- addEventListener
- setAttribute
- getAttribute
- data-name
- document.querySelector
- createElement

## Rules of Memory Game
- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches, you get +1 to your score
- These cards then disspear
- If the next card you flip does not match, then you try again and card return the original state.
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
- When the game is over, a button is created which allows you to restart the game with a different order on the cards
